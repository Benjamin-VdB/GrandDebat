# GrandDebat
Topic mining analysis for the Grand Debat public consultation in France https://granddebat.fr/ 

This consultation includes 4 main domains : Ecology, Taxes and public spend, Democracy and Public services.
20 to 30 questions on each domains, free text answers.

A summary of 500 pages has been released! Not very satisfying...

The intent of this analysis is to map each questions/domains around main discussed topics, provide a brief and complete overview in a few visualisations, and cross the 4 domains to extract representative profiles of the population.
